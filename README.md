# Out of Control; talk on feedback, complexity and nature's resilience

Let's not talk about whether climate change is real. Let's not expect a magic bullet to fix it. Let's not ponder the collapse of the systems that sustain the Western world, for too long.

Rather, let's explore how nature deals with unpredictable change, how it evolves and adapts and even gains from disorder. As opposed to tight control loops, nature goes with 'what is' and, using remarkably little energy, uses it to replicate and sustain
lifeforms and information.

As part of the [Decentralized Society Research Project](https://dsrp.eu), I'm exploring future scenario's where groups of people might choose to opt out of collective self-destruction.

In this talk, I hope to explore design principles that might increase the likelihood for (parts of) civilization to survive. I'm very much open to your input and hope to leave about half the time for discussion.
